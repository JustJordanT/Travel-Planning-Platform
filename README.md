# Collaborative Travel Planner Microservices Architecture

## Project Overview
A full-stack collaborative travel planning application that allows users to create, share, and collaborate on travel itineraries across multiple services.

### Microservices Architecture
1. User Service
2. Trip Service 
3. Location Service
4. Collaboration Service

## Core GraphQL Schema (Federation)
```graphql
TBD
```

## AWS Lambda Function Example (TypeScript)
```typescript
TBD
```

## React Frontend Component
```typescript
TBD
```

## Key Technologies
- Apollo GraphQL Federation
- TypeScript
- React
- AWS Lambda
- AWS API Gateway
- DynamoDB (suggested for persistence)

## Proposed Features
1. User authentication
2. Trip creation and management
3. Collaborative trip planning
4. Location recommendations
5. Real-time collaboration

## Deployment Considerations
- Use AWS CDK for infrastructure as code
- Implement CI/CD with GitHub Actions
- Use AWS Cognito for user authentication
- Leverage AWS AppSync for real-time updates
```

```

The project showcases:
- Microservices with GraphQL Federation
- TypeScript across frontend and backend
- AWS Lambda serverless functions
- React frontend with Apollo Client
- Modular service-oriented architecture

Key architectural components:
1. Federated GraphQL services for Users, Trips, Locations
2. Serverless Lambda functions for data retrieval
3. React frontend with dynamic querying
4. Scalable and extensible design

Would you like me to elaborate on any specific aspect of the architecture or discuss implementation strategies for any of the services?
